The goal of MoleculeExperiment is to provide functionality for the representation and summarisation of imaging-based spatial transcriptomics data, including 10X Xenium.

We used the following data bundles to inform our readXenium, readCosmx and readMerscope functions respectively. In particular,
Xenium data corresponds to [3 replicates from fresh frozen mouse brain tissue](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/fresh-frozen-mouse-brain-replicates-1-standard), accessed on 8 February 2023;
CosMx data corresponds to [human non-small cell lung cancer](https://nanostring.com/resources/smi-ffpe-dataset-lung9-rep1-data/) accessed on 27 February 2023; and
MERSCOPE data is from [human ovarian cancer](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/vz-ffpe-showcase/HumanOvarianCancerPatient2Slice2) accessed on 27 February 2023.
