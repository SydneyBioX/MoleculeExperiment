# docs: method to add new sample data to an existing object.

# TODO change file name to avoid collation problems (should be loaded after class definition)

# ARGS: method should be able to 1) read in new data from new transcripts.csv
# or 2) read in new data from a data frame already in memory. 



#    # check that modified object is still a valid instance of ME class
#    validObject(x)
