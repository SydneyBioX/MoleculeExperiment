\title{Read in Merscope data to an ME object}
\usage{
readMerscope(dataDir, keepCols = "essential")
}
\arguments{
\item{dataDir}{Character string specifying the directory with the Cosmx
output files.}

\item{keepCols}{Vector of characters specifying the columns of interest from
the transcripts file. "essential" selects columns with gene names, x and y
locations. "all" will select all columns. Alternatively, specific colums
of interest can be selected by specifying them as characters in a vector.
Note that this personalised vector needs to contain the essential columns.}

\value{
A MoleculeExperiment object
}
\description{
Reads in Merscope data (Vizgen) from a directory, and standardises it into
a MoleculeExperiment object. It is essentially a wrapper around the function
readMolecules(). Note that this function can currently only create a simple
ME object with the molecules slot filled. Boundary information cannot be
handled yet.
