# SpatialUtils
R package with convenience functions for molecule-based spatial transcriptomics
data analysis (xenium by 10x, cosmx SMI by nanostring, and merscope by vizgen).
Introduces a new class to store ST data: MoleculeExperiment class.

# Why the MoleculeExperiment class?
1) Enable easy analysis of spatial transcriptomics data at the molecule level, 
rather than the cell level.
2) Standardisation of molecule-based ST data across vendors, to hopefully
facilitate comparison of different data sources.

# The ME object 

## Constructing an ME object
- instructions on how to use readMolecules() correctly
- highlight benefits of how readMolecules() works
e.g., readMolecules enables the user to decide if they want to keep all the 
data that is vendor-specific (e.g., qv in xenium).

## ME object structure
- what are the slots?
for now @molecules 

- what information does each slot contain?
highlight how this enables standardisation of ST data across different vendors.

- what is the format in which the information is stored?
for now the list format

- why is information stored like this?
performance reasons? (e.g., enabling minimal copying and thus less memory 
intensive?)

# Methods to work with an ME object
- Briefly introduce all methods that can be used to access and manipulate data 
in the @molecules slot.
- Then explain each method in detail, and compare their performance when used
on the ME implementation (list) or the naive implementation (df) of the data. 
Show microbenchmarking results in R code chunks
    - summarisation functions
    - getters (data reading)
    - setters (data manipulation)
    - plotting functions
